# Bubble sort algorithm

## Introduction

> Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm
that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent
items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is
repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  The
algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements
_bubble_ to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow
and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.
